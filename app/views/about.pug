          //- Replace the boilerplate below with your best elevator pitch
          p  I'm a design thinker and collaborator who loves the process of turning ideas into products that delight customers. I have several years of experience in digital and print design, with specialties in Graphics and user experience design (UX/UI). I'm a firm believer in working hard and challenging yourself to improve and develop my skills so you never stop learning. My design process is focused on using design-led methodologies to provide clear and creative design solutions, while having an impact on people's daily lives. And I love it when my work impacts someone else.
